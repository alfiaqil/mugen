CHARACTER INFO (source: http://www.the-oro.com)
============================================================================
Name: Himura Kenshin (Hitokiri Battousai)
Age: 28 (June 20,1849)
Style: Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu
Other: Type AB, 48 Kg, 158 cm (5'3'')

Basics
  Himura Kenshin aka. the Hitokiri Battousai appears in the anime/manga from 
  the very start of the manga and anime. He is the main character of the whole 
  series and is now a Rurouni (wanderer). His physcial attributes include red 
  hair, a cross-shaped scar on his left cheek,black/blue eyes and his undeniable 
  shortness :P. Kenshin follows the school of Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu which teaches 
  him to fight many foes at one time. His most famous technique is the Battoujutsu 
  where he moves at god-like speed to defeat his opponents. His weapons include 
  a Sakabatou (a reverse-bladed sword) and his sheath (well i think its sort of a 
  weapon cause he uses it as one a few times ;) ). His master is Hiko Seijuro but 
  he currently lives in a Dojo with Kamiya Kaoru and all his other friends.

History
  Kenshin (or Shinta) was born at a time where Japan was under turmoil and he was 
  sold to slavery after his family's death. However, one or two days later the 
  caravan is attacked by some samurai/bandits who kill everyone including three 
  women who try to protect Kenshin (he is a little kid). When the men kill the 
  women and go after Kenshin they are unsuccessful as a man appears and kills them 
  first. He leaves Kenshin on his own and tells him to start a new life. A couple of 
  days later, the man, Hiko Seijuro, finds a graveyard while walking down a path. 
  He discovers that Kenshin has dug all the graves for the men and women as well as 
  the samurai who killed them. Seijuro introduces himself and asks Kenshin's name, 
  Kenshin replies "Shinta" and Seijuro states that he needs a new name, thus naming 
  him "Kenshin." From thereon Kenshin becomes Hiko's pupil and trains. Like all kids, 
  he has an ambition, that is to protect people, and he tells Hiko that he wants to 
  fight and protect the people who are being killed in Japan during the war. Hiko, 
  of course, rebukes him but Kenshin insists and leaves anyways. Pretty soon Kenshin 
  becomes a hired as a secret assassin (a hitokiri) for the Ishin Shishi. During the 
  OVA (this whole story and part of Kenshin's life) Kenshin is seen falling in love 
  with a woman Tomoe. After a twist of events Kenshin recieves his cross-shaped scar 
  and vows never to kill again after the restoration of the Meiji. Kenshin is off 
  duty as a Hitokiri shortly afterwards and kills openly to "establish a new era." 
  Shortly afterwards he disappears and reappears in Tokyo 10 years later in the 11th 
  era of the Meiji. Now he becomes a wanderer and has abandoned the name he earned 
  during the Bakamatsu, the "Hitokiri Battousai" (named after his Battoujutsu and 
  Killing Technique). This is where the 1st volume of the manga and first episode of 
  the anime begins. In these episodes he meets characters such as Kamiya Kaoru, Myojin 
  Yahiko, and Sagara Sanosuke who become his friends, but also those from the Bakamatsu 
  who reappear and drag him back into battles. He strives to keep to his Rurouni ways 
  and never kill again...

Watsuki's Character Notes
The following is quoted off of Shonen Jump's RK graphic novel translations of Watsuki:

  "Himura Kenshin. Based somewhat on the actual Hitokiri,Kawakami Gensai. Sort Of. Except 
  Totally Different. Kawakami Gensai was one of the four great Hitokiri, or assassins of 
  the revolutionary (Bakamatsu) period. He was short and skinny and could be mistaken at 
  first glance for a woman. Contrary to his appearance, though, he was clever and clear-headed 
  despite being most dreaded among all of the hitokiri.
  
  Master of an original sword-style called "Shiranui-Ryu," Kawakami is famous for felling 
  the great idealist Sakuma Shozan in one swing, in mid-day. Kawakami is nevertheless a 
  mysterious figure, however, as there are no certain records of his other assassinations.
  After the revolution-and unableto let go of the idea that Japan should remain closed to 
  the world-Kawakami found himself in frequent conflict with the revolutionary government. 
  Ultimately, he was accused of a crime he did not commit and executed in the 4th year of Meiji.

  As I researched further, it began to occur to me that the story wasn't so clear cut and dried. 
  What this hitokiri could not let go of was his duty to his fallen comrades, and to the men 
  that he had killed. It's this that gave me the initial idea for the "Kenshin" character. As 
  for the others, there is the selflessness of okita Soshi of the Shinsengumi and the mysterious 
  quality of Saito Hajime...but, then again, who knows.

  In terms of graphic designs, I had no real motif. The main character of my debut work was a 
  tall, black-haired man in showy armor, so when I set out to design someone completely opposite 
  of him, he ended up looking like a girl (heh). Not knowing what else to do, I put a cross-shaped 
  scar on the left cheek. Now that same cross marks the spot at which the Battosai became Kenshin...
  or so I've heard!
