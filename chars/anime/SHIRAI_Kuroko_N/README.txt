- An accurate version of SHIRAI Kuroko from PS3 Game "Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax Ignition"
- For Mugen 1.1 beta



=====<Features>=====

- All features from "Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax Ignition"
  except boost character selection, Ignition boost and between round upgrade.

- Extra sub / support characters for selection. (will be added later)

- Custom mode which have moves not in original game.


=====<Compromise and walkarounds>=====
Due to the limitation of the MUGEN engine. It's not easy for me to give you a boost character select screen
so you can only select boost type based on palette Numbers.

1 will give you RED Power blast, 
2 will give you BLUE Cancel blast and 
3 will give you Green Escape Blast
4 same as 1
5 same as 2
6 same as 3
and so on.....

=====< Color / palette election >=====
She have more than 12 palettes
you can choose Pal 1-12 color by
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3
a = 4
b = 5
c = 6
x + Start = 7
y + Start = 8
z + Start = 9
a + Start = 10
b + Start = 11
c + Start = 12

on each palette you can hold start and press up / down to select a color +12 or +24
For example
you are on palette 2
you can select 2 + 12 = 14 or 2+24 = 26 by hold start and press up / down



====< Modes >====
the character have 2 modes
Standard mode = normal, just like she in original game (Dengeke Bunko fighting climax ignition)
Custom mode = have some moves not in original game.

to access Custom mode.
	-Press and hold the start button when you are in support character selection screen
	-or Hold start button in main character seletion screen to choose color palettete 7-12 (every primary color have 2 sub color)



=====< Controller settings >
If you are using a Keyboard the default setting is fine
If you are using a PS4 or Xbox gamepad you can go the Command.def
under remapping
use ; to mask / comment out the keyboard mapping
and unmask / un-comment the gamepad part
