---------------<Mode Overview>------------------

Morrigan has two different modes, here's a brief description:

<Normal Mode>
-Remains based on her CvS2 moveset. Nothing extra.

<Arranged Mode>
-Still uses the CvS2 moveset as base, but expands on it a bit with a few extra moves, 
 and different functionality of the same moves based on her MvC/TvC appearances.

No life/defense/attack value differences between the two modes.
Normal mode is the default mode. Hold start when selecting her for Arranged mode.

---------------<Character Info>------------------

(**Note: 1-10 Ranking System: 1 = Lowest, 10 = Best)

 - Intelligence: 8
 - Strength: 4
 - Speed: 7
 - Stamina: 4
 - Energy Projection: 8
 - Fighting Ability: 7

The very beautiful, supposed main char(protagonist) of Capcom's Darkstalkers series, Morrigan Aensland.
While it may be considered or even intended once that Demitri is the main char, Morrigan's appeal far exceeds his.
Landing her in dozens of crossover titles and cameo appearances in various Capcom games. She's certainly-
a fan favorite. In terms of her fighting ability, she's actually pretty basic. Once again, mostly a female-
incarnation of Ryu. However, in this case it isn't so much a ripoff, as she's a Capcom char herself afterall.
Morrigan's fighting style more involves zoning foes and picking the most opportune time to strike upclose.
As such, she has great projectile proficiency(especially in "Arranged" mode) along with good anti-air defense.
She doesn't have much in the way of expansion moves though, outside of her supers. Unique to her fighting build however,
she has a command grapple. Which can definitely throw foes off guard up close. Being able to "fly" in a sense can-
also help out with keeping her foes weary of her fighting strategy. Low stamina/defense is a given with her of course.
Not the fastest, but faster than average. Overall, I find it best to be patient with her, or else you'll find yourself-
in a world of hurt fast.

---------------<Gameplay Notes>------------------

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Most Normal standing/crouching attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Most Air attacks can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Performing a Super/MAX Cancel resets the juggle points but also reduces damage dealt
 - Ground normal chaining is possible with Morrigan. However, if you chain, you can NOT Special/Super-
   cancel from her normals.
   
MAX MODE:
 - Your attack and defense is increased while in MAX Mode
 - EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
 - All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Alpha Counter/Counter Movement while in MAX Mode
